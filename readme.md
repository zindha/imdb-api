If you anticipate sending a large number of requests, it is recommended that you deploy your own Cloudflare worker. Installation is pretty easy and straight forward. Click the button below to get started.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/weebzone/IMDB-API)

After deployed, map the worker to a Domain Name to configure cache. Only Workers deployed to custom domains have access to functional cache operations.
